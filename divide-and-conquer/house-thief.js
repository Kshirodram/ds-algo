/*
There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbors left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value?
Examples: 
 

Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
